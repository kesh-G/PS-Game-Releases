You actually play as this new character, Mono, a young boy trapped in a world distorted by the humming transmission of a distant tower, and Six is his guide to discover the Signal Tower's dark secrets.

                    Dying Light came out back in 2015, and since then many have been hoping for a sequel, so when news hit that Dying Light 2 was in fact happening, the excitement for another zombie fest from Techland was palpable. The second game takes place 15 years after the first, and one human settlement still stands in the 'modern dark age' the infected world has fallen into. There are more RPG elements on offer this time around, with difficult choices and sacrifices to make to help or hinder the world.
